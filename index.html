<p>My name is Alex. Thereâ€™s many things I'm interested in that led me to choose this course. I really enjoy playing video games, 3D modeling, and assembling computer hardware, but never really had the chance to properly learn to script or create my own programs. Especially now during quarantine, I have gotten very interested in game and website development, and would like to improve my understanding of code. I think this course lines up with my interests, and I'm prepared to learn more.</p>
